 Data Integration of Australia Victoria's Housing Information

In conjunction with assessment of FIT5196 - Data Wrangling where one is provided with 7 datasets on housing, hospitals, shopping centres, supermarkets, Melbourne train data and Victoria suburbs of various formats (json, xml, txt, html, xlsx, csv, shp) and is required to integrate them into one single schema.

Extracted all information using Python data processing libraries like xml.etree, json, shapefile, numpy and pandas and integrated them into a single panda dataframe

Studied the effect of different transformation/normalisation methods (i.e. standardization, minmax normalization, log, power and sqrt transformation) on the housing price in Python using sklearn and math packages
